## Tasks to code 

### To compile and run from console:  
Go to `src` folder in any project and write from there:  
```
g++ [evdokimova_project.cpp] -o [project] -I /usr/include/python3.8/ -I include/ -lpython3.8  
./project  
```

## Task: [DIFFRACTION GRID](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/tree/main/difraction_grid)  
### To compile and run use Cmake:  
Go to `build` folder and write from there: 
``` 
cmake ..  
make  
./[evdokimova_project_name]  
```  

Result:  
![plot](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/difraction_grid/Figure_1_diff_grid.png)  
  
## Task: [POTENTIAL HOLE](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/tree/main/potential_hole).  

### To compile and run use Cmake:  
Go to `build` folder write: 
``` 
cmake ..  
make
./[solutions]  
or
./[levels]  
or  
./[waves]  
```  

Result:  
Solutions:  
![plot](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/potential_hole/Figure_4.png)  
  
Levels:  
![plot](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/potential_hole/Figure_5_levels.png)
