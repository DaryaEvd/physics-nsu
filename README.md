## Tasks to code 

### To compile and run from console:  
Go to `src` folder in any project and write from there:  
```
g++ [evdokimova_project.cpp] -o [project] -I /usr/include/python3.8/ -I include/ -lpython3.8  
./project  
```

## Task: [DIFFRACTION GRID](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/tree/main/difraction_grid)  
### To compile and run use Cmake:  
Go to `build` folder and write from there: 
``` 
cmake ..  
make  
./[evdokimova_project_name]  
```  

#### Result:  
![viewOfGrid](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/difraction_grid/pictures/Diffraction_grid.png  )  
  
## Task: [POTENTIAL HOLE](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/tree/main/potential_hole)   

### To compile and run use Cmake:  
Go to `build` folder write: 
``` 
cmake ..  
make
./[solutions]  
or
./[levels]  
or  
./[waves]  
```  

#### Result:  
##### Solutions:  
![solutions](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/potential_hole/pictures/Solutions.png)  

  
##### Levels:  
![symmetric](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/potential_hole/pictures/Symmetric_levels.png)  
![assymetric](https://github.com/DaryaEvd/physics/blob/main/potential_hole/pictures/Assymmetric_levels.png)  

##### Waves:
